# Simplistic Matrix Engine

For this project I created a basic matrix unit that could be utilized in deep learning. The matrix unit  will perform matrix multiplication, scaler multiplication, subtraction, addition and transposition. A testbench will place a starting set of matrix RAM and place opcodes fro the execution unit to perform the matrix functions using the matrix modules.

## Porject Details

* All math functions will have a clear input set to zero.
* The register value needs to be able to be written back into memeory location 
* All matricies will be 4x4 16 bit deep 
* Matrix multiplier will multiply two 4x4 matrix and return a 4x4 matrix 
* Scalar multiplication is multiplying a matrix by single number
* Add and subtract will add and subtract 2 4x4 matrix
